        <h2>What is Python?</h2>
        <p>
          Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van
          Rossum, and released in 1991.
        </p>
        <p>It is used for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>web development (server-side)</li>
          <li>software development</li>
          <li>mathematics</li>
          <li>system scripting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What can Python do?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
          <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
          <li>
            Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify
            files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex
            mathematics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready
            software development.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why Python?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry
            Pi, etc).
          </li>
          <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
          <li>
            Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with
            fewer lines than some other programming languages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be
            executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can
            be very quick.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or
            a functional way.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>

        <h2>Python Indentation</h2>
        <p>
          Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
          Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for
          readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python
          uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
        </p>
        <code
          >if 5 > 2: <br />
          print("Five is greater than two!")</code
        >
        <h2>Python Variables</h2>
        <p>In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:</p>
        <code
          >x = 5 <br />
          y = "Hello, World!"</code
        >
        <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>
          Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code
          documentation. Comments start with a #, and Python will render the
          rest of the line as a comment:
        </p>
        <code>#This is a comment. print("Hello, World!")</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Python_Variables">
        <header>
          <h1>Python Variables</h1>
        </header>
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
        <h2>Creating Variables</h2>
        <p>
          Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created
          the moment you first assign a value to it.
        </p>
        <code
          >x = 5 <br />
          y = "John" <br />
          print(x) <br />
          print(y)</code
        >
        <p>
          Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can
          even change type after they have been set.
        </p>
        <code
          >x = 4 # x is of type int <br />
          x = "Sally" # x is now of type str <br />
          print(x)</code
        >
        <h2>Casting</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done
          with casting.
        </p>
        <code
          >x = str(3) # x will be '3' <br />
          y = int(3) # y will be 3 <br />
          z = float(3) # z will be 3.0</code

          <h1>Python Data Types</h1>
        </header>
        <h2>Built-in Data Types</h2>
        <p>
          In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can store
          data of different types, and different types can do different things.
          Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these
          categories:
        </p>
        <p>
          Text Type: str <br />
          Numeric Types: int, float, complex <br />
          Sequence Types: list, tuple, range <br />
          Mapping Type: dict <br />
          Set Types: set, frozenset <br />
          Boolean Type: bool <br />
          Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Python_If...Else">
        <header>
          <h1>Python If...Else</h1>
        </header>
        <h2>Python Conditions and If statements</h2>
        <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Equals: a == b</li>
          <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
          <li>Less than: a < b</li>
          <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
          <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
          <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if
          statements" and loops. An "if statement" is written by using the if
          keyword.
        </p>
        <code
          >a = 33 <br />
          b = 200 <br />
          if b > a: <br />
          print("b is greater than a")</code
        >
        <p>
          In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part
          of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33,
          and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to
          screen that "b is greater than a".
        </p>
        <h2>Elif</h2>
        <p>
          The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions
          were not true, then try this condition".
        </p>
        <code
          >a = 33 <br />
          b = 33 <br />
          if b > a: <br />
          print("b is greater than a") <br />
          elif a == b: <br />
          print("a and b are equal")</code
        >
        <p>
          In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true,
          but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b
          are equal".
        </p>
        <h2>Else</h2>
        <p>
          The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding
          conditions.
        </p>
        <code
          >a = 200 <br />
          b = 33 <br />
          if b > a: <br />
          print("b is greater than a") <br />
          elif a == b: <br />
          print("a and b are equal") <br />
          else: <br />
          print("a is greater than b")</code
        >
        <p>
          In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not
          true, also the elif condition is not true, so we go to the else
          condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Python_While_Loops">
        <header>
          <h1>Python While Loops</h1>
        </header>
        <h2>Python Loops</h2>
        <p>Python has two primitive loop commands:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>while loops</li>
          <li>for loops</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The While Loop</h2>
        <p>
          With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a
          condition is true.
        </p>
        <code
          >i = 1 <br />
          while i < 6: <br />
          print(i) <br />
          i += 1
        </code>
        <p>
          The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this
          example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.
        </p>
        <h2>The Break statement</h2>
        <p>
          With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while
          condition is true:
        </p>
        <code
          >i = 1 <br />
          while i < 6: <br />
          print(i) <br />
          if i == 3: <br />
          break <br />
          i += 1
        </code>
